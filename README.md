 ## Project Overview

---> Description

Encrypt or decrypt files using AES-256 (Fernet module from cryptography library).

---> How to Run

Run the script in Jupyter or VS Code.

Choose:

1 to Encrypt a file

2 to Decrypt a file

Provide:

File path (e.g., C:/Users/RAYI/Documents/message.txt)

Password (used to generate AES-256 key)

---> Inputs Required

File path: The full path of the file to encrypt or decrypt.

Password: Any custom password (same one should be used during decryption).

 ### Advanced Encryption Tool
- **Purpose**: Encrypt and decrypt files using AES-256 encryption (Fernet)
- **Tech Used**: `cryptography`, `hashlib`, `base64`
- **Run**: Choose to encrypt or decrypt. Enter file path and password.

##  How to Run All Projects
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open each `.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook** or `.py` file in **VS Code**.
3. Follow instructions in each folder's `README.md`.
